# Whack-a-word_android

Create a simple game for young children to learn vocabulary, that can be used on an Android tablet.

Overview
A series of holes in the ground are present. To start, a vocabulary card pops up from one of the holes, with a flashcard image. 
The child hears the word on the card then must tap it, after which they hear the word again then receive some positive feedback - a tick with sound effect. 
If they don't tap it, it retreats into its hole and pops up again in a random one. 
After three successful taps, the child starts to get more vocabulary moles simultaneously - two, then three. 
They must choose the correct one, or all retreat into their holes.
